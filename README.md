# 👋 Hey there, I'm so glad you're here! I'm Mohit Raj!
Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!

## 🌟 About Me
🎓 **B.Tech in Computer Science, Class of 2025**  
🔍 **Aspiring Data & Business Analyst**  
🌟 Passionate about uncovering insights, solving problems, and helping businesses grow with data

I'm someone who’s endlessly curious about how things work — especially when it comes to people, products, and patterns hidden in data. I believe analytics is a blend of logic, creativity, and empathy — and I try to bring all three to the table.

As a fresher stepping into the corporate world, I’m focused on building solutions that don’t just answer "what happened?" but help businesses understand the "why" and "what next?"

## 📊 My Approach to Analytics

I see data as more than numbers. It’s a narrative — and I enjoy turning that narrative into visuals and insights that businesses can act on.

Whether it’s a marketing campaign analysis or a website traffic dashboard, I aim to bring clarity, simplicity, and value to every project I touch.
