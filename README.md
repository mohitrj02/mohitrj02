## 🌟 About Me

I'm someone who’s endlessly curious about how things work — especially when it comes to people, products, and patterns hidden in data. I believe analytics is a blend of logic, creativity, and empathy — and I try to bring all three to the table.

As a fresher stepping into the corporate world, I’m focused on building solutions that don’t just answer "what happened?" but help businesses understand the "why" and "what next?"

## 🧠 Beyond Work: What Shapes Me

- 📸 **Photography Enthusiast:** I love capturing stories through my lens — the little details, the emotions, the unspoken moments.
- 🍳 **Cooking Explorer:** From street-style snacks to homemade comfort food, cooking keeps me grounded and creative.
- 🌱 **Gardening Buff:** There's something satisfying about nurturing life, one plant at a time.
- 🐾 **Animal Lover:** I believe empathy makes us better — at home, at work, and in life.

These hobbies reflect who I am: observant, hands-on, patient, and always learning.

## 📊 My Approach to Analytics

I see data as more than numbers. It’s a narrative — and I enjoy turning that narrative into visuals and insights that businesses can act on.

Whether it’s a marketing campaign analysis or a website traffic dashboard, I aim to bring clarity, simplicity, and value to every project I touch.
