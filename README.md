# 👋 Hey there, I'm so glad you're here! I'm Mohit Raj!

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!

I'm someone who’s endlessly curious about how things work — especially when it comes to people, products, and patterns hidden in data. I believe analytics is a blend of logic, creativity, and empathy — and I try to bring all three to the table.

🎓 **B.Tech in Computer Science, Class of 2025**  
🔍 **Aspiring Data & Business Analyst**  
🌟 Passionate about uncovering insights, solving problems, and helping businesses grow with data

As a fresher stepping into the corporate world, I’m focused on building solutions that don’t just answer "what happened?" but help businesses understand the "why" and "what next?"

## 📊 My Approach to Analytics

“Data is not just numbers — it’s a story.”
 I treat analytics as a bridge between business questions and actionable answers. 

**My process involves:**

🔍 **Identifying patterns in user behavior**  
📈 **Creating intuitive visual dashboards**  
🎯 **Providing clear, impactful insights**

## 🧠 Beyond Work: What Shapes Me

- 📸 **Photography Enthusiast:** I love capturing stories through my lens — the little details, the emotions, the unspoken moments.
- 🍳 **Cooking Explorer:** From street-style snacks to homemade comfort food, cooking keeps me grounded and creative.
- 🌱 **Gardening Buff:** There's something satisfying about nurturing life, one plant at a time.
- 🐾 **Animal Lover:** I believe empathy makes us better — at home, at work, and in life.
